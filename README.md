# OACC - Order-agnostic constexpr configuration

**Production patterns from Nihilus**

> ⚠️ **Important**: These libraries are used internally at Nihilai Collective,

> execution model, or deployment techniques.

## What This Is
- General-purpose C++20/23 patterns for heterogeneous type collections
- Zero-overhead abstractions used in our production systems
- Examples of modern template metaprogramming techniques

## What This Is NOT
- Our LLM inference engine (that's proprietary)
- Our hardware optimization layers (patent pending)
- Our deployment infrastructure (commercial product)

## Why We're Open Sourcing This
We believe in advancing C++ systems programming. These patterns have served us well, 
and we want to share them with the community while focusing on our core product: 
**the Nihilus LLM inference ecosystem**.
